* lumen automatic updates

This repo is intended to set up k8s scheduled jobs to update lumen datasets.
Each lumen instance that we want to update should have its own job, which means that should have a branch in this repo with the same name (eg: unicef branch https://github.com/akvo/akvo-lumen-automatic-updates/tree/unicef to update https://unicef.akvolumen.org/ lumen instance).

These are the steps to follow to add a new lumen dataset(-uuid) to update


1- Search for the branch/lumen-instance-name you want to update, if not exists create a new one starting on "main" and using the lumen-instance-name as branch name
2- Update branch values according your needs. eg: unicef changes https://github.com/akvo/akvo-lumen-automatic-updates/compare/unicef#diff-3db03b056e588432b22814fac93c11d44c8a4d8d958713cd2bf70b1d1d0ab48d
3- Ensure that email account lumen-automatic-updates-bot@akvo.org is authorized to access the lumen data and flow data
4- Push branch to this repo and wait for the successful build on semaphore https://akvo.semaphoreci.com/projects/akvo-lumen-automatic-updates
